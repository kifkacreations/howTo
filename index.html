<ol>
    <li>In a large soup pot or dutch oven, combine short ribs, onion, carrot chunks, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, salt and water.    </li>
    <li>Bring it to a boil and then lower the heat, cover and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is falling off the bones. Remove the scum that floats to the top with a spoon several times in the beginning.</li>
    <li>While the broth is simmering, heat 1 Tbsp oil in a pan and sauté diced onion for 2-3 minutes. Add chopped garlic and grated carrot and sauté till the carrot starts to soften up, about 6-8 minutes. Plate it out.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, add 1 Tbsp more oil and sauté grated beets for 4-5 minutes. Add sugar, ½ Tbsp white vinegar, and tomato paste and cook for 12-15 minutes, until the beats are tender. You will add this this to the soup pot later.</li>
    <li>Once the Borscht stock is done, remove the short ribs. Discard the bones and shred the meat into big chunks. Discard the vegetables and strain the beef broth.</li>
    <li>Bring the beef broth to a boil again and add back in beef along with potatoes. Let it simmer on medium low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the sautéed onion and carrot mixture along with shredded cabbage, salt and pepper. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add grated beet mixture and let it simmer again for 7-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in 2 Tbsp white vinegar along with chopped dill, parsley and sliced garlic, and let it simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt and vinegar.</li>
    <li>Let it sit at least for 30 minutes to meld all the flavors. Serve with fresh dill, a few garlic slices and a dollop of sour cream.</li>

<h2 id="ukrainian_garlic_bread">Ukrainian Garlic Bread</h2>
<img src="resources/images/bread.jpg" width= 600 height = 400/>
<h3 class="ingridients">Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 cups milk lukewarm    </li>
    <li>3 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>5 tbsp avocado or olive oil</li>
    <li>7 cups bread flour</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
    <li>1 egg for the tops</li>
    <li>1 tbsp water for the tops</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sunflower, avocado or olive oil    </li>
    <li>5 garlic cloves minced    </li>
    <li>1 tbsp course sea salt    </li>
    <li>5 tbsp fresh dill chopped    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk, sugar and active dry yeast together. Cover the bowl with a towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add in eggs and oil and whisk until well-combined.    </li>
    <li>Combine the salt and flour. Using either a stand mixer or your hands, add in the flour mixture in small portions, kneading it until the dough is elastic. Cover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rise for about an hour.    </li>
    <li>Grease a baking pan with oil. Divide the dough into 24 equal-sized pieces, rolling them into a ball shape. Place each dough ball onto a baking sheet, leaving about 1-inch of space between each.</li>
    <li>Cover the pampushky with a towel and let them rise for about 30 minutes, or until they double in size. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tablespoon of water together. Brush the mixture on the tops. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the pampushky turn golden brown.    </li>
    <li>While the pampushky are baking, combine the oil, minced garlic, dill and salt in a small bowl.    </li>
    <li>Brush the tops of the warm bread with the garlic mixture. Serve immediately and enjoy!    </li>

<h2 id="potato_varenyky">Potato Varenyky</h2>
<img src="resources/images/varenyky.jpg" width= 600 height = 400/>
<h3 class="ingridients">Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups whole milk    </li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, 1 stick    </li>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling    </li>
    <li>1 egg    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt    </li>
    <li>4 large russet potatoes, peeled and quartered    </li>
    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter    </li>
    <li>kosher salt, for water to taste    </li>
    <li>2 bay leaves    </li>
    <li>¼ cup whole milk    </li>
    <li>unsalted butter</li>
    <li>sour cream    </li>
    <li>fresh dill, or green onions    </li>
    <li>caramelized onions, optional    </li>
    <li>crispy bacon, optional    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot to a boil, salt with water to taste. Peel the potatoes and cut into quarters. Add to water along with bay leaves and cook uncovered on medium heat until fork tender. About 10-12 minutes.    </li>
    <li>Remove from heat, drain water and remove bay leaves.    </li>
    <li>Add butter and mash until smooth. Add milk and using a spoon whip the potatoes until combined.</li>
    <li>Add milk and butter pieces into a pot and heat until butter melts on low heat. Mix to combine. Let cool for 5 minutes.    </li>
    <li>In a bowl add flour, salt and 1 egg, whisked. Slowly add in the slightly cooled milk and butter mixture. Stir to combine.    </li>
    <li>Once dough is formed, add some flour on your countertop and knead the dough for 2-3 minutes.    </li>
    <li>Set the dough aside and cover to rest for 10 minutes.    </li>
    <li>Once you are ready to make your first batch of vareniki, divide your dough into 3 pieces. Cover the pieces you aren’t using.    </li>
    <li>Roll out the dough thinly on a floured surface to just under 1/8” thickness. Using either glass or a 3 inch cookie cutter, cut out round shapes. Keep the shapes as close as possible, keeping the scraps (add them to the unused dough to reuse).    </li>
    <li>Add 1/2 Tbsp of potatoes over each round piece of dough, fold over in half and pinch together to seal and make a half moon shape. To ensure a tight seal, crimp the edges a second time with a pinch and twist motion.    </li>
    <li>Place the prepared vareniki on a floured baking sheet to prevent sticking.    </li>
    <li>If making ahead, you can freeze them and once frozen on the floured baking sheet, add to a freezer bag and store until ready to use.    </li>
    <li>If making ahead, you can freeze them and once frozen on the floured baking sheet, add to a freezer bag and store until ready to use.    </li>
    <li>Cook for about 10-12 minutes, then once the vareniki are floating and water is back to a boil, the dough should be very tender. Carefully remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add butter and gently toss to combine. Add to a bowl, top with sour cream and fresh dill or green onions and enjoy. Or kick it up a notch and cook up some caramelized onions and bacon to add as a topping along with sour cream and fresh herbs.    </li>
